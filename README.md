The project here focuses on Design Challenge #2: On-boarding of optimal foster families in the most efficient manner possible.
1）How can data and/or a digital solution be used to expedite a foster family applicant being “scored” by agencies?
2）How can you increase the number of families you can onboard without having to necessarily feed more applicants into the process?
Classification Tree and 2-mode Unfolding Multidimensional Scaling Model are used to solve these problems.
This repository contains processed data, codes and visualizations related to this project.
The project was carried out by Chuheng Hu, Jingtong Feng, Yan Xu, and Zhuqian Zhou together.
